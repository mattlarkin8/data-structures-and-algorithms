# **Stacks and Queues**

Both stacks and queues are data structures that store values in linked nodes.
Stacks use a LIFO data scheme, while Queues use a LILO data scheme.
This means that Stacks function as a stack of nodes, where you are always working with the node that is on top of the stack.
Similarly, Queues function as a line of nodes, where you are always working with the node that is at the front of the line.

## **Challenge**

We had to create push, pop, peek, and is_empty methods for both the Stack and Queue class. This allows us to add a new node to the top or rear, remove the top or front node and return its value, look at the value of the top or front node, and check if the Stack or Queue is empty and return the appropriate error.
