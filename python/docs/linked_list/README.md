# **Singly Linked List**

Allows for the creation of singly linked lists. New nodes can be created and added to the list. You can search the list for a value and get a True or False response if the value is in the list. The `__str__` function returns a string containing all the values in the list.

## **Challenge**

This challenge required us to create a singly linked list using classes. The list must have attribute functions that allow you to add a node to the front of the list, search for a value in the list, and return a string representing all the values in the list.
