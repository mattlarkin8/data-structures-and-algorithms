# **Graphs**

A Graph is a data structure that stores data in nodes. A graph node is called a Vertex. These vertices are linked to each other with Edges. The whole graph is represented as an adjacency list, which specifies the links that each node has. In our implementation the adjacency list is a dictionary of lists, where each list contains the links for a certain node.

## **Challenge**

This challenge required us to create a `Graph` class with the following methods: `add_node`, `add_edge`, `get_nodes`, `get_neighbors`, and `size`. To accomplish this, we also had to create a `Vertex` class and an `Edge` class.
