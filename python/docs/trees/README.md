# **Binary Tree and BST**

Allows for the creation of a Binary Tree or Binary Search Tree. Tree are a collection of Nodes that link together similar to a Linked List. A Binary Tree has two links to other Nodes. These links always exist even if they don't link to another Node, in which case it links to None. Nodes must be properly ordered by value to be a BST. The order is based on the value of the root Node.

## **Challenge**

This challenge required us to create a class BinaryTree and then another class BinarySearchTree that inherits BinaryTree. BinaryTree was required to have three methods: pre_order, in_order, and post_order. BinarySearchTree required had two required methods: add and contains.
