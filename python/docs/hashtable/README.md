# **Hash Table**

A Hash Table is a data structure that stores key-value pairs in buckets. The key gets hashed to determine the index where it should be stored. There is a bucket at each index of the list in the Hash Table. These buckets are another data structure and can contain multiple key-value pairs. In our implementation the buckets are Linked Lists.

## **Challenge**

This challenge required us to create a class `Hashtable` containing the following methods: `set`, `get`, `contains`, `keys`, `hash`.
