# **Quick Sort**

Quick Sort is another divide and conquer sorting algorithm. It takes a list of values and assigns one of those values as the `pivot` point. It then places the `pivot` in the list so that all values to its left are less than `pivot` and everything to the right is greater than `pivot`. This process is then repeated with recursion to sort both sub-lists that are to either side of `pivot`.
